This is a unity project that simulates two planetary bodies revolving around a star and does necessary calculations needed to execute a hoffman transfer from the first planet's synchronous orbit to the secod planet's synchronous orbit. 
The user can change a range of variables: mass of the star, the mass of each planet, their distance from the star, how many times faster the simulation runs fromreal time and more.
There isn't an implemented user inteface, the user needs to view the variables from the editor window instead.
